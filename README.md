# 📱 Samsung E-commerce Clone

A fully functional **Samsung e-commerce web application clone** built using **React.js**, **Bootstrap**, and **CSS**. This project is created to showcase my skills in building a responsive, feature-rich shopping interface with **React**.

Users can **browse, add to cart, and remove products**, with seamless navigation implemented via **React Router DOM**, and real-time cart operations powered by **Axios** and a custom API.
